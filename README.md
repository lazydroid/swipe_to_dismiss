This project is originally developed by Roman Nurik and is availabe from his git repo, I have just converted it to the Android Studio to be able to include as a library into other projects.

Android Swipe-to-Dismiss Sample Code
====================================

Sample code that shows how to make `ListView` or other views support the swipe-to-dismiss Android UI pattern.

See the original [Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/+RomanNurik/posts/Fgo1p5uWZLu) for discussion.

See also [Jake Wharton's port](https://github.com/JakeWharton/SwipeToDismissNOA) of this sample code to old versions of Android using the [NineOldAndroids](http://nineoldandroids.com/) compatibility library.
